# E-Commerce App
My first project with Blazor web assembly.
I provided admin menu to add products with several variants.
I implemented features like viewing featured products, searching products, adding products to shopping cart, and placing order for clients.
I also provided admin dashboard to add new products, edit prices, mark products as featured, and so on.
